Case 3: PRODSUP-003:

Dear customer support,
I need to explain how CircleCI works to my boss. I’ve read the docs but I still don’t get it. Can you please
explain to me, in your own words, how CircleCI works? Also, it seems like you don’t support .NET builds.
Why is that?

Case 3 reply : 

Hello Adam,

CircleCI is a platform which helps to deliver the code with better quality and in an efficient way. It is platform for both Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

1) Continuous Integration : With CircleCI, we can automatically test(Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Functional Tests) all the changes which are available to our code base. 
2) Continuous Deployment : If our tests pass, then we can deploy our code to development, staging, production, or other environments. However it depends on the infrastructure we are deploying to. 
Some examples are 

AWS CodeDeploy
AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS)
AWS S3
Google Container Engine (GKE)
Heroku
Deploy Using SSH


CircleCI’s Role: CircleCI integrates with your version control system (GitHub/Bitbucket) and automatically runs a configured series of steps every time a change is detected in the project. We can also configure automatic deployment after the test cases executed successfully.
It supports most popular mobile platforms
i) Android 
ii) IOS 
and 8 web technologies  i.e
i) Go(Golang)
ii) Haskell
iii) Java
iv) Node.js
v) PHP
vi) Python
vii) Ruby / Scala
viii) Scala

It do not officially support .NET technology. Some users have had luck with the "mono framework" or "docker" which can install via circle.yml
.NET is a Windows technology, and CircleCi is running on Linux machines.


You can find in detail information about CircleCI on the site https://circleci.com/docs
