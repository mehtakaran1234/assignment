Case 2: PRODSUP-002:

Hi. I added my project to CircleCI but I can’t get the build complete. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong.
Can you help? My project is https://github.com/nym2015/commons-csv.

Hello Jolene,


I have looked into your issue and need your suggestion on below piece of code.
Could you please explain me what do you want to achieve with it?

File : commons-csv/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java at line 795

/**
* Verifies the consistency of the parameters and throws an IllegalArgumentException if necessary.
*
* @throws IllegalArgumentException
*/
private void validate() throws IllegalArgumentException {
	for (int i=0; i<20*60*60; i++) {
	    System.out.print('.');
	    try {
	        Thread.currentThread().sleep(1000);
	    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
	        break;
	    }
	}
....
....
}


The program execution halts on this piece of code. 
For troubleshooting, I have commented it and tried running test cases and it executed perfectly fine for me.
Please and check and confirm if it works for you as well. 

Also, If you do not change,code will still work but it will take very long duration to execute.

Kindly let me know, if you have any queries regarding the same.
