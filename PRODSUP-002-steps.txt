Steps :-

Case 2: PRODSUP-002 :

1) Fork the application from "https://github.com/nym2015/commons-csv".
2) Build the project.
3) The project gets hung at the below file location. 
There is no logic involved in it and as many number of times the method gets called it will sleep the current thread 1000 millseconds each time.
File : commons-csv/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java at line 795
4) Troubleshoot the problem by commenting out the code as below.
/**
* Verifies the consistency of the parameters and throws an IllegalArgumentException if necessary.
*
* @throws IllegalArgumentException
*/
private void validate() throws IllegalArgumentException {
	/*for (int i=0; i<20*60*60; i++) {
	    System.out.print('.');
	    try {
	        Thread.currentThread().sleep(1000);
	    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
	        break;
	    }
	}*/
....
....
}
5) Commit and push the changes in git as 
6) After removing this code it works perfectly fine and test cases perform successfully.
